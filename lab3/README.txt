I failed at designing a program that converts from ascii to binary. I had a very
hard time with the operations as well as finding where the data was. I
ended up being able to locate and manipulate the user input from the text 
argument. I created all the operation blocks, but I got lost within my code. 
I'm sure it's a problem with my jumps or branches but I can't find where. I went 
through the debugging process but I still haven't found it. I will continue 
working on this until it is due, but here is my writeup just in case I can't 
finish. I can't see where my code is wront, I think my logic is right. I 
attended several labs and MSI's. I got a lot of help there. I will continue
going to try and find out how to do my code.
