I would go about making a digit display by having several switches each hooked up to one certain LED light out of the 9 LED lights that make up the digit display, but I would make a truth table for the combinations of ones and zeroes that makes certain numbers and use those to trigger the digit display. I believe in this way I would be able to make a digit display.

I’m not very sure how a random generator works, but I’m sure there are logic gates implemented in them. Other than that I don’t see how random numbers are generated.
