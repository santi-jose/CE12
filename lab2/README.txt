Your Lab 2 work *must* be done in this directory.
I believe the purpose of this assignment was to learn the logic behind the adder.
It also showed us an important component in every computer. 
My method was to read the lab instructions and try to figure it out from there.
I didn't have any real method other than following the directions and going to 
sections and MSI. My results were pretty good. I got the adder to work and 
understand all the logic behind it, but I couldn't figure out how to add
subtraction. In the end I wasn't able to finish but I did learn a lot from this 
lab. Some things that I learned from this lab are the logic behind an adder as 
well as how to make a register. Something that really helped me work things out
for this lab was to draw things on paper before trying to build them all on the
pallet. An issue I had building my circuit was that the register had to be 
cleared before every use for a value to be determined. I thought my whole 
circuit was bugged or something, but it was only the register needed to be 
cleared.
